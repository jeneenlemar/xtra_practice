# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.
# num1 = 10

# if num1 == 10
#   p 0
# else
#   p -1
# end



# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# my way
# num1 = 10

# if num1 == 10
#   p 0
# elsif num1 > 10
#   p -1
# elsif num1 > 10
#   p 1
# end

# #pj solution
# number = 3

# if number < 10
#   p -1
# elsif number > 10
#   p 1
# else
#   0
# end





# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

# num1 = 2
# num2 = 4

# if num1 < 10 && num2 < 10
#   p 1
# else
#   p 0
# end

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

# num = 20000
# if num > 9000
#   p 1
# else
#   p -1
# end

# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# num = 41

# if num < 10
#   p 9
# elsif num < 20
#   p 19
# elsif num < 30
#   p 29 
# else
#   p -1
# end

# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.

# num1 = 3
# num2 = 66

# if num1 > 10 || num2 > 10
#   p 100
# else
#   p -100
# end

# 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

# num1 = -9
# if num1 < 0
#   p 1776
# else
#   p 1979
# end

# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.
# num = 99

# if num == 100
#   p 100
# elsif num == 99
#   p 99
# else
#   p 0
    
# end

# 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.
# num1 = -1
# num2 = -2

# if num1 < 0 && num2 > 0
#   p 1
# else
#   p 0
# end



# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

num = 19

if num > 80
  p 5
elsif num > 60
  p 4
elsif num > 40
  p 3
elsif num > 20
  p 2
else
  p 1
