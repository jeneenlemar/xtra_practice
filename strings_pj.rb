# first = "Al"
# last = "Bundy"

# puts first + " " + last

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# last = "Bundy"

# puts "#{first} #{last}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# puts "please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   puts "polo"

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "blue"
# color3 = "yellow"

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# title = "It"
# author = "SK"

# puts "The book " + title + " is written by " + author + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# title = "It"
# author = "SK"

# puts "The book #{title} is written by #{author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# puts "Enter a password:"
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   puts "Shall we play a game?"
